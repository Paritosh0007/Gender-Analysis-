# Gender-Analysis-
## About:- 
* Gender inequality has been a social issue in India for centuries. That in many parts of India, the birth of a girl child is not welcomed is a known fact.
* It is a known fact too, that discrimination starts from even before the girl child is born and sometimes she is killed as a foetus, and if she manages to see the light of day, she is killed as an infant, which makes up the highly skewed child sex ratio where for every 1000 boys in India, there are only 908 girls. In such a scenario, it is but obvious that for myriad reasons, many girls across the country are forced to drop out of school.
* Patriarchal norms have marked women as inferior to men.
* A girl child is considered a burden and is often not even allowed to see the light of the world.
* It is hard to imagine this state of affairs in the 21st Century when women have proved to be strong leaders in every field possible.
